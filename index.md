## This is Chris Du

I am a student at UCSD. I draw. 


### Portfolio

I will add some of my pictures here.


### Commissions

You shouldn't consider clicking these links yet, but I want to throw them here for fun. Stripe has these beautiful payment links, which makes buying things very easy.

Before you want me to draw something, please send me an [email](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com) with the following descriptions:
* Who are you
* How did you find me on this big Internet
* What would you like me to draw
* Why do you think I'm a good candidate for that (for real)
* Logistics - how do you want it, how long can you give me, details, etc.

If you are ready to continue, here are the options:
* [Small commission (2-4 weeks)](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY5mi1WcdZZ6ME001)
* [Large commission (longer than 4 weeks)](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe6qm58oaNN4EwaEE)

Thanks.
