## This is Chris Du

I am a student at UCSD, biology major for now. 

I've been drawing regularly for two years. I mainly use graphite and ink, since I prefer grayscale. I've also been learning to use color pencils recentlyâ€¦ emphasis on learning. I enjoy drawing in a variety of styles, but macabre and ominous subjects are most appealing. You can tell by my self-portrait below.

### Commissions

Pleae don't actually buy anything here. I have these links for fun. These Stripe payment links are so nice. 

I'd love to draw things for you in the future. Please send me an [email](mailto:michaelhe@hey.com) with the following:
* Your introduction (name, location, whatever else)
* How did you find me
* The subject of the piece (keywords, reference, contexts, anything helpful)
* To make sure I'm the right candidate for you, why me?
* More details - time, details, price, how you want it done, etc. 

If you are ready to continue, here are the options:
* [Small commission (2-4 weeks)](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY5mi1WcdZZ6ME001)
* [Large commission (longer than 4 weeks)](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe6qm58oaNN4EwaEE)

Thanks.
